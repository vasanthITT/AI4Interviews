    "wellness_report": "It seems like you're feeling a bit stuck in a rut right now.  Your answers indicate that you're not prioritizing your well-being in several key areas. \n\nHere's a starting point for making some positive changes:\n\nSleep: Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep each night.  Try establishing a relaxing bedtime routine and creating a sleep-conducive environment (dark, quiet, cool). \n\nExercise: You're already exercising 3 times a week, which is great!  Consider adding variety to your routine or increasing the intensity to challenge yourself further. \n\nStress Management:  A 3 out of 10 stress level suggests you're feeling some pressure. Explore mindfulness techniques like meditation or deep breathing exercises. Even 5-10 minutes daily can make a difference.\n\nDiet:  Focus on whole, unprocessed foods like fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins.  \n\nGeneral Wellness:\n\n Find Your Motivation:  Think about what truly matters to you and set small, achievable goals that align with your values.  \n Connect With Others:   Nurturing your relationships can boost your mood and sense of belonging. Schedule time for social activities. \n Gratitude Practice:  Take a few minutes each day to reflect on things you're grateful for. This can shift your perspective and improve your overall well-being.\n Address Restless Nights: If sleep continues to be an issue, consider consulting a healthcare professional.\n\nRemember, small changes can lead to big results over time. Be patient with yourself and celebrate your progress along the way.\n\n\nRecommended Packages:  Since you're looking to improve your well-being across multiple areas, the \"Focus Flow\" package might be beneficial. It often includes elements of stress management, mindfulness, and productivity techniques.",
